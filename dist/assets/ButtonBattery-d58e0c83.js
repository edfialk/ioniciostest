            <p><strong>Immediately</strong> remove batteries lodged in the esophagus.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Consider sucralfate suspension or honey if ≤ 12 hours post-ingestion.</li>
              <li>Do not delay removal if patient has eaten.</li>
              <li>Prefer endoscopic removal (instead of retreival by balloon catheter or magnet affixed to tube) for direct visualization of tissue injury.  Inspect mucosa for extent, depth and location of damage.  Note position of battery and direction negative pole faces.</li>
              <li>If no endocscopic evidence of perforation, irrigate areas of esophagus with 50-150 mL 0.25% sterile acetic acid to neutralize residual alkali.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After removal, if mucosal injury was present, observe for and anticipate delayed complications:  tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal perforation, mediastinitis, vocal cord paralysis, tracheal stenosis or tracheomalacia, aspiration pneumonia, empyema, lung abscess, pneumothorax, spondylodiscitis, or exsanguination from perforation into a large vessel.</p>
            <p>Anticipate specific complications based on injury location, battery position and orientation (negative pole).  Determine length of observation, duration of esophageal rest, need for serial imaging or endoscopy/bronchoscopy based on severity and location of injury.  Monitor patients at risk of perforation into vessels as inpatients with serial imaging and stool guaiacs.  Intervene early to prevent fatality.  Monitor for respiratory symptoms, especially those associated with swallowing, to diagnose TE fistulas early.  Expect perforations and fistulas to be delayed (98% diagnosed by 48 days after battery removal) and esophageal strictures delayed weeks to months.</p>
