      <p>Notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The team (Pediatric Surgery or IR) who placed the line should be first
          consulted for removal or replacement, but we are willing to co-manage
          on a case-by-case basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peds Surgery is fine with IR replacing lines, as needed, if patient is
          already sedated with them and line canâ€™t be salvaged.
        </li>
        <li>
          tPA (Alteplase) dwell and infusion can be coordinated with infusion
          clinic. VAT (Vascular access team) may be able to assist.
        </li>
        <li>Power Hickmans are not compatible with ethanol locks</li>
        <li>
          Power Hickman cuffs are 2 or 5 cm above the retention hub (most are 5
          cm)
        </li>
        <li>Lines do not need to be re-sutured if 4 weeks or older</li>
      </ul>
